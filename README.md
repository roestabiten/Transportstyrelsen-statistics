# Transportstyrelsen-statistics
A program built in Python 3.6 that retrieves fatal road accident statistics from the Swedish Transport Agency

My occupation as of 2018 is working with aviation incidents at the Swedish Transport Agency. So I thought it would be fun to check out 
our API's. 

The aviation department of the authority doesnt have any open data API's, though we have a couple of road API endpoints. 
So I decided to check that out, thats the reason I created this application.

The installation file can be downloaded at:
